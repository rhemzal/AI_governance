# Measured Performance — Advisory Note

## Core Idea
Performance decisions should be based on **measurement and budgets**, not assumptions.

## Practical Heuristics
- Define a performance budget for critical flows.
- Benchmark under representative conditions.
- Prefer changes that keep boundaries intact; break boundaries only when measured.

## When This Fails / Failure Modes
- Benchmarks do not represent reality.
- Measurements are noisy/non-deterministic.
- The team treats performance as a late-stage emergency only.
