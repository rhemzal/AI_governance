# Security Policy

## Supported content

This repository contains governance documents and scripts. There is no deployed service.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe there is a security issue (e.g., accidental secrets, unsafe scripting guidance, or a workflow that could cause harm):

- Prefer reporting privately via GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability") if enabled.
- If private reporting is not available, open an issue and **do not** include sensitive details.

Maintainers will acknowledge reports when possible and will prioritize removing exposed secrets immediately.
