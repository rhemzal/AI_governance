# Local Notes (Personal / Not Committed)

This folder is for **personal** scratch notes (parking-lot items, temporary lists, quick prototypes).

It is intentionally excluded from version control:
- root `.gitignore` ignores `notes/local/**`
- this `README.md` is explicitly unignored so the folder exists in every clone/import

## Usage
- Keep your own files here (whatever helps you work quickly).
- Do not expect these notes to be reviewed or shared via PR.
