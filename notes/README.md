# Notes (Working Notes / Parking-Lot)

This folder provides a low-friction place to capture project notes without derailing active work.

**Important**: notes are not canonical documentation. Canonical rules and guidance live in `constitution/`, `ci/`, `usage/`, and ADRs under `adr/`.

## Structure
- `notes/committed/` — shared notes that are committed to the repo (reviewable).
- `notes/local/` — personal notes that are intentionally not committed (ignored by `.gitignore`).

## Guidelines
- Prefer links over duplication: if something becomes a real decision, capture it as an ADR and link it here.
- Keep committed notes **append-only and link-first** (avoid rewriting history; add links to the Issue/ADR/PR where resolved).
