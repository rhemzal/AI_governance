# Committed Notes (Shared)

Use this folder for **shared** notes that are worth keeping in git history.

## Policy (Recommended)
- Treat these notes as **non-canonical** by default (working notes).
- Prefer **append-only** updates:
  - add a new entry rather than rewriting existing entries
  - add links to the Issue/ADR/PR where the item was resolved
- Keep the scope small and practical. If a note becomes authoritative, promote it to:
  - an ADR (`adr/`), or
  - a canonical usage/governance document under `constitution/` / `usage/`.

## Suggested sub-structure (optional)
- You may create per-person or per-topic files/folders, e.g.:\n  - `notes/committed/by-person/<name>.md`\n  - `notes/committed/by-topic/<topic>.md`\n\nKeep names stable and avoid excessive fragmentation.
