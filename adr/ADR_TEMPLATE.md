_Provenance: This template originates from the AI_governance kit (https://github.com/rhemzal/AI_governance). If you copied it into another repository, keep this line to preserve traceability._

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context
- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints exist (technical, organizational, regulatory)?
- What is known and what is unknown?
- Externalities considered (if applicable): security, privacy, cyber resilience, supply chain, accessibility, data residency, operational constraints (see `research/PROFESSIONAL_STANDARDS_AND_REFERENCES.md`).

## Decision
- What did we decide?
- What is explicitly out of scope?

## Alternatives Considered
- Alternative A — why not?
- Alternative B — why not?

## Trade-Offs
- Benefits
- Costs
- Failure modes

## Sensitivity Points & Risks
- Sensitivity points (small changes that can break key quality attributes)
- Trade-off points (where improving one attribute harms another)
- Risks and unknowns
- How we will validate/measure (tests, benchmarks, gates)

## Points of No Return
- What becomes difficult to change later?
- How would rollback work (if at all)?

## Consequences
- Immediate consequences
- Long-term consequences

## Enforcement
- How do we keep this decision true?
  - CI gates
  - tests
  - documentation

## Documentation Impact
- Source of truth for this topic:
- Docs to update (paths):
- Docs to remove/merge (paths):
- Generated docs?
  - yes/no
  - regeneration process:

## Governance Change (If Applicable)
Use this section when the ADR changes governance (rules/gates/overlays) or upgrades an imported governance kit.

- Is this a governance change? yes/no
- If upgrading an imported kit: old version (tag/SHA) → new version (tag/SHA)
- Local overlay impact (if any): additions/overrides/none
- Enforcement impact: what new evidence is required, what gates change
- Migration/rollout plan: how teams adopt the change and how conflicts are handled
