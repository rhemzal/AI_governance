# Code of Conduct

This project is intended to be a professional, low-drama place to collaborate on AI-assisted development governance.

## Our standards

We expect participants to:
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent; ask clarifying questions before escalating.
- Focus feedback on the work and the reasoning, not the person.
- Prefer evidence: examples, reproductions, and proposed text changes.
- Keep discussions actionable and within the scope of this repository.

We do not accept:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Publishing private information ("doxxing").
- Spam, trolling, or intentionally derailing discussions.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions and comments that violate these standards.
Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from participation.

## Reporting

If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior, open a GitHub issue marked **security/private** if possible, or contact the maintainer via the email listed in the repository profile.
